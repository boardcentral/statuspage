Just a heads up that we're starting some maintenance on the
servers.  Access may go down from time to time but only last
a minute or so at a time.

I'll update my progress here as I go.  I expect it to all take
less than an hour.

Update: 10am  Issue with new configs... deploying a fix should
        be up momentarily.

Update 10:24 Wow... rolled back to previous version and app
       is running again.  Continuing maintenance

Vince
